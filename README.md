### Challenge Description:
Quantum Modeling of Humidity-Dependent Reaction Kinetics in the Nile Delta  
Title: Quantum Simulation of Sulfate Aerosol Formation under High Humidity Conditions  
Relevance: The Nile Delta experiences humidity >80% year-round, accelerating sulfate aerosol formation from industrial emissions. This quantum challenge simulates how humidity affects:  
SO‚ÇÇ + OH ‚Üí HOSO‚ÇÇ ‚Üí SO‚ÇÉ ‚Üí SO‚ÇÑ¬≤‚Åª (sulfate aerosol)

### Problem Statement
Develop a hybrid quantum-classical model that:  
1. Simulates the reaction pathway energy surface for SO‚ÇÉ + nH‚ÇÇO ‚Üí H‚ÇÇSO‚ÇÑ clusters (n=1-3)  
2. Predicts reaction rates at 60-100% relative humidity  
3. Maps quantum outputs to aerosol nucleation probabilities
